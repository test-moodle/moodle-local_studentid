# This is a plugin based on the moodle learning platform, which is used to automatically generate a student ID when creating a user, and allows the user to freely set the prefix of the student ID and whether to use the student ID as the username for the user's login.

## **You can clone this folder into your_moodle_folder/local and open your Moodle website to install it.**

The student id format is [prefix + create_date + userid].

suppose prefix = 'stu', userid in the database is 33, create date is 2024/11/12, the student ID will be stu2024111233

Here is the demo screen capture:
